            AnnoCultor: a tool for data conversion and semantic enrichment
            ------
 

 AnnoCultor allows converting databases and XML files to {{{http://www.w3.org/RDF/}RDF}},
 and semantically tag them with links to vocabularies, to be published on Linked Data and the Semantic Web.
 
AnnoCultor Converter

 AnnoCultor Converter allows converting SQL databases, XML files, and SPARQL datasets
 to RDF. Converters are written in XML in a simple declarative way,
 and common XML editing skills are sufficient to write one.
 
 When specific transformations are needed, pieces of Java code can be easily
 plugged into the XML converters, ranging from a simple statement like 
 <<<substringAfter(",")>>> to large blocks of code. 
 
 AnnoCultor is flexible from both sides: it allows plugging in 
 small Java programs to parse input data custom or legacy formats, or to 
 produce non-RDF output data, e.g. Solr documents. 
 
 AnnoCultor Converter was used to convert dozens datasets, ranging 
 from simple, where all objects have the same structure, 
 to complex, where input objects are different and interlinked, and need to
 be restructured to interlinked output objects.
  
AnnoCultor Tagger

 AnnoCultor Tagger allows assigning semantic tags to your data. 
 Here the tags correspond to terms from existing vocabularies,
 e.g. term 'Paris' from Geonames contains translations in a dozen languages,
 augmented with coordinates, population, and other data. 
 AnnoCultor can find and link this tag to a document, allowing new 
 features, such as showing this document on a map.
 
 AnnoCultor Tagger has been recently used to semantically tag nearly 7 million
 records from the {{{http://europeana.eu}Europeana}} collections with location data,
 see {{{http://mariateresa.isti.cnr.it/~borys/europeana/Ese_Places/index.html}tagging statistics report}}.
 
 AnnoCultor is suitable for any vocabulary, with experience in 
 Geonames and Getty TGN (places),  
 Getty ULAN and RKD (people), 
 Getty AAT and Gemet (general terminology),
 SVCN (mix), and others.
 
AnnoCultor Time Ontology
 
 AnnoCultor Time Ontology is a vocabulary of time periods: 
 milleniums, centuries, half centuries, quarters, decades, and years.
 It also includes historical periods, like middle ages.
 
 It can be used with AnnoCultor out-of-the-box to augment various representations of
 periods with exact dates to show them on a timeline.
 
Release Terms and Assistance 

 AnnoCultor is an open-source project released under the Apache License that allows commercial reuse.
 It needs to be customised to each specific data source and target format, see our {{{http://borys.name/papers/porting08.pdf} experiences on costs}}).
