            Converter: Geonames
            ------
 

 This converter translates the {{{http://www.geonames.org/ontology/}Geonames}} vocabulary to a stripped-off RDF representation. 
 We developed two ready-to-reuse converters for 
 the two ways in which Geonames is available: daily updated CSV files 
 and an (often outdated) RDF dump.
 
Converting up-to-date CSV version

 First, download two files: 
 {{{http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/allCountries.zip}allCountries.zip}} 
 and
 {{{http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/alternateNames.zip}alternateNames.zip}},
 and unzip them to directory 
 <<<annocultor/converters/geonames/input_source/>>>.
 
 Now its simple - run <<<convertCsvToRdf>>> from  <<<annocultor/converters/geonames>>>.
 And look into <<<annocultor/converters/geonames/output_rdf/>>>.
 By default it will convert Europe only. With a slight modification to 
 <<<convertCsvToRdf>>> it can be set to convert other continents.
 
RDF dump, often outdated
 
 Geonames describes millions objects, with an RDF file of more than 6 Gbytes. They are available as a 
 {{{http://download.geonames.org/all-geonames-rdf.zip}dump txt file}}. In this file each record describes a place (called Feature) with a dozen or two
 properties. These records are already represented in RDF, as small RDF files. These files are merged into
 a single large text dump, where each record is separated with a line containing its identifier. 
 
 Download this dump and save it to <<<annocultor/demos/converters/getty/input_source/>>>.
 
 Class {{{http://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/src/main/java/eu/europeana/semantic/converters/geonames/GeonamesDumpToRdf.java}GeonamesDumpToRdf}} separates them and groups per continent
 and per country. 
 Run it with script {{{http://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/geonames/}TODO}}. 
 It should produce a number of files in <<<annocultor/demos/converters/getty/input_source/>>>
 
 These files are valid RDF files and can be loaded to a triple store as-is. However, 
 many applications only use a fraction of the fields provided by Geonames.

Source files
 
 {{{http://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/geonames/} Parent directory for source files}}
 in the AnnoCultor source repository.
 
   
Converter

 The {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/geonames/profile/profile-geonames.xml}Geonames converter}}
 filters out several fields, drastically reducing the size of the RDF.
 
 This converter shows a peculiar way of using AnnoCultor. Typically, AnnoCultor is used to
 convert XML files or SQL databases to RDF. In this converter we convert RDF to RDF. In fact,
 we process the source RDF document at XML level and perform usual conversion. 
  
 The conversion 
 {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/geonames/profile/parameters-getty.xml}parameters}}
 are separated in a file, as usual. 
  
 This converter illustrates the following AnnoCultor features:
 
 * translating RDF to RDF
 
 * multiple source files 
 
 * property rename
 
 * sequence of rules
  
 * qualified identifiers.
