            Tutorial: How to run
            ------
 

Converter

 Please, check out AnnoCultor from Subversion, and look at the demos
 (directory <<<demos>>>) to see how a custom converter can be built
 and executed. 
 
JDK
 
 JDK 6 is required.
  
Command line 

 In the demo examples converters are located in <<<profile/profile.xml>>>
 and working directories are assumed to be called <<work>> 
 (you may choose any other). To run a demo you need execute the following command
 from the directory of the demo 
 (e.g. {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/icn/convert.bat}ICN <<<convert.bat>>>}}):
  
+------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
convert
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Please, refer to file <<<pom.xml>>> 
 (e.g. {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/icn/pom.xml}ICN <<<pom.xml>>>}}) for more details on how it works.
 
Results
 
 After a run you should get a lot of console messages and, if lucky,
 some files in the <<<outputDir>>> set in the converter.
