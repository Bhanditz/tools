            Converter: Louvre
            ------
 

 This is a converter of the dataset of the {{{http://www.louvre.fr}Louvre museum}} in Paris.
 
Source files
 
 {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/louvre/} Parent directory for source files}}
 in the AnnoCultor source repository.
 
Data 

 In this dataset each source record, e.g. Mona Lisa (what else!) is represented with a separate
 XML file, with a total dataset of 17553 files. 

 In the demo we use just one record to illustrate how AnnoCultor can handle it all. 
 This describes Mona Lisa and it is located in 
 {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/louvre/input_source/14153.xml}file 14153.xml}}
 
Analysis
 
 Here is the 
 {{{http://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/annocultor/demos/converters/louvre/doc/analysis.html} analysis}}
 produced by the AnnoCultor Analyser run over the whole dataset.
  
Converter

 The 
 {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/louvre/profile/profile.xml} converter in XML}}
 illustrates the following AnnoCultor features:
 
 * part-of objects
 
 * converting a part-of object to a few properties of the parent object
 
 * wildcards on source files 
 
 * property rename
 
 * people, places, and terms lookup
 
 * using listeners on converter and listeners on object rules together.
