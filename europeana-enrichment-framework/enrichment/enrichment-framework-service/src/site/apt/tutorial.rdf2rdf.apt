Using AnnoCultor to convert and filter RDF documents

  Sometimes we need to convert an RDf document to another RDF document. Typically, this is needed to
  
  * filter some fields out. A typical situation is a vocabulary where each term is described with 
    a few labels and a long change log, tens times larger that the term itself. In many
    applications we would like to use the latest snapshot of terms, ignoring their change log. This can also be
    done with SPARQL construct queries.
  
  * restructure RDF document. The two typical cases are: extracting several literal fields of an RDF object
    into a separate RDF object linked to the parent one; flattening RDF objects by making a few fields
    of a part-of object fields of the parent object self.  
    
  * filter some records out. In a situation where decision whether a record should be included or not
    depends on a non-trivial condition. For simple conditions SPARQL queries can be more efficient.
  
  * change values of some fields. Prefixing values, changing namespaces, cleaning data.
  
  Some of the RDF-to-RDF conversions may be efficiently done by SPARQL construct queries.
