Source files
 
 In the local checkout navigate to <<<annocultor/demos/converters/>>>. 
 Here the converters are.
 
Maven POM files
 
 Each converter has a standard <<<pom.xml>>> file. This file serves two goals:
 
 * it uses Maven dependency mechanism to ensure that the most recent AnnoCultor release is downloaded and used for conversion;
 
 * it lets Maven resolve JDK path and uses <<<${java.home}>>> to find the Java executable to run the converters.
 
 
Running

 Each converter has scripts like <<<convert.bat>>> or <<<convert.sh>>>
 
 Running converters may not be straightforward. 
 Please, refer to their descriptions.
