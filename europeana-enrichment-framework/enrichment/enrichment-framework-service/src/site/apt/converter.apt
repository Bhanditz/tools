 Converter defines the source datasets (files or databases) that
 need to be converted, the target files where the results should be stored,
 and conversion rules.
 
Representation and operation

 AnnoCultor converter is represented as an XML file.
 During conversion, this XML file is translated to Java program code
 and this Java code is executed under the hood.
 However, this process is hidden from the user.
 Many converters can be write with XML knowledge only, just using any XML editor.
 
 When needed, AnnoCultor allows fine-grained control over the conversion.
 For this, small Java programs of one or few lines can be easily included
 into these XML converters.
