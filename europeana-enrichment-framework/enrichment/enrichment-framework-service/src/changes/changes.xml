               Lookup rules can fetch terms by URI. Typically, we want to fetch concept URI by label, 
               but sometimes we know the URI and want to fetch terms' labels.

               SOLR server as a datasource. Data from a running SOLR server can be converted,

               It is often necessary to add/remove a few statements from the large generated RDF files.
               New feature OntologySubtractor that allows removing statements from an RDF file (to-be-removed-from)

               SparqlQueryHelper allows merging a few RDF files (also just-generated conversion results)
