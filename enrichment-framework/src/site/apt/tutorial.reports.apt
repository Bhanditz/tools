How to get

 Ensure that parameter <<<docDir>>> is set in your converter:
 
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
 <ac:Parameter>
  <ac:name>docDir</ac:name>
  <ac:value>doc</ac:value>
 </ac:Parameter>
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

 After a _successful_ conversion a directory named after the converter id, 
 holding file <<<index.html>>> should be created in the directory specified with <<<docDir>>>,
 holding a conversion report.   
 
What is there

 The most important things are:
 
 * Rule invocation 
 
  Rule invocation counters tell how many times each rule was used.
  
 * Forgotten XML tags
 
 Section Forgotten XML tags lists XMLtags that are not converted. Possibly because they were
 overlooked and a corresponding conversion rule was not created.
