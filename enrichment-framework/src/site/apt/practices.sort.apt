            Best practices: sort in query

 Version control {{{provides great benefits}practices.vc.html}} in practical conversion.
 If a few values of a single property have changed during a new conversion
 then it is easy to review these changes in a plain-text diff tool.
 
 That works as long as RDF resources are ordered in the same way on each conversion run.
 Text diff tools do line-by-line comparison, and they are not aware of any RDF semantics.
 If the order in which RDF resources are saved has changed then text diff tools suddenly become useless:
 from the line-to-line comparison it looks like every line has changed,
 while from the RDF perspective the file may remain the same.
 
 A change in the 'WHERE' condition may have dramatic effect on the order in which 
 records are returned.
 
 Best practice here is: sort query results. In this way you will control their ordering.
 
 Both SQL and SPARQL have the <<<ORDER BY>>> statement for that.
